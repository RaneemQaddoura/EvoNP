    Purity score

    To compute purity, each cluster is assigned to the class which is most frequent 
    in the cluster [1], and then the accuracy of this assignment is measured by counting 
    the number of correctly assigned documents and dividing by the number of documents.abs

    Parameters

        y_true: np.ndarray: n*1 matrix Ground truth labels
        y_pred: np.ndarray: n*1 matrix Predicted clusters
    
    Returns

        Purity score: float
